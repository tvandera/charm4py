Charm4py includes a launcher called ``charmrun`` to run parallel applications on
desktops and small clusters. Supercomputers and some clusters provide their
own application launchers (these can also be used to launch Charm4py applications).

charmrun
--------

After installing Charm4py as explained in the previous section, you can launch
applications like this::

    $ python3 -m charm4py.charmrun +p4 myprogram.py

The option ``+pN`` specifies how many processes to run the application with.

Alternatively, if ``charmrun`` is in your PATH (this depends on where Charm4py was
installed and your system configuration)::

    $ charmrun +p4 myprogram.py

You can launch an *interactive shell* using the ``++interactive`` option, for
example::

    $ python3 -m charm4py.charmrun +p4 ++interactive

Charm4py programs accept the `same command-line parameters`_ as Charm++.

Running on multiple hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``charmrun`` can run an application on multiple hosts (e.g. a network of workstations)
by passing it a file containing the list of nodes (*nodelist* file). Hosts can be
specified by IP address or host name. For example, this is a simple nodelist file
specifying four hosts::

    group mynodes
        host 192.168.0.10
        host 192.168.0.133
        host myhost
        host myhost2

The application can be launched like this::

    $ python3 -m charm4py.charmrun +pN myprogram.py ++nodelist mynodelist.txt

With this method, charmrun uses ``ssh`` to log into remote machines and spawn processes.

charmrun can also use the cluster's ``mpiexec`` job launcher instead of the built-in ssh method.

See the `charmrun manual`_ for more information and alternative ways to work with nodelist
files.

.. important::
  If you need to set environment variables on the remote hosts, you can let
  charmrun do it by adding your export commands to a file called ``~/.charmrunrc``.

Using charmrun from a Python program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can launch a Charm4py application from inside a Python application,
and wait for it to complete, in this manner:

.. code-block:: python

    from charmrun import start

    start.start(['+p4', 'myprogram.py'])  # launch parallel application and wait for completion


Note that you can also use Python's ``subprocess`` library and launch the same command
as you would via the command line.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue
    Program hangs with no output when launching with ``charmrun``.

Solution
    This typically occurs when launching the program on multiple hosts, and an error
    ocurring before starting charm (e.g. syntax error). To diagnose, launch the
    program on a single host.


mpirun (or equivalent)
----------------------

If you have built Charm4py to use MPI, you can launch Charm4py applications
using mpirun, mpiexec or other valid method on your system that supports
launching MPI applications. For example::

    $ mpirun -np 4 /usr/bin/python3 myprogram.py

See :doc:`install` for instructions on building Charm4py for MPI.

You can launch an *interactive shell* with mpirun like this (or similar command)::

    $ mpirun -np 4 /usr/bin/python3 -m charm4py.interactive

Note that the console has limited functionality in terms of tab completion, etc.
due to stdin and stdout limitations when using mpirun.


Using system job launchers
--------------------------

Charm4py applications can also be launched using system job launchers
(e.g. aprun, ibrun, SLURM).
The exact details of how to do so depend on the system, and typically Charm++ has
to be built with a specialized network layer like MPI, GNI or OFI
(see `Charm++ manual build`__).

.. __: install.html#manually-building-the-charm-shared-library

In all cases, the mechanism consists in launching one or multiple Python processes
on each node, and passing the main application file to Python. Here is a simple script
for SLURM on a Cray-based system:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash -l
    #SBATCH -N 8         # number of nodes
    #SBATCH -t 00:30:00
    #SBATCH -C knl

    module load craype-hugepages8M
    module load python/3.6-anaconda-4.4

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/charm4py
    PYTHON_EXEC=`which python3`

    srun -n 512 -c 1 $PYTHON_EXEC myprogram.py app_param1 app_param2 ...
